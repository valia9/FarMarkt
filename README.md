# FarMarkt

This was my first major project, perhaps this is why it is still in progress.

FarMarkt initially was heavily based on Colt Steele's project from his Udemy course. Nevertheless,
at some point, I gave up on its origin and now it can barely be traced back.

FarMarkt is meant to navigate Prague locals and tourists on the Farmers Markers (FM).
FM take place almost daily here, depending on where you reside.
However, one big drawback is that there is essentially no single page that would
be user-friendly enough to help everyone interested find the closest market -- 
geographically or time/date-wise. Thus, FarMarkt was born.


Update 10/2020

I decided to simplify the project drastically so it becomes usable ASAP.
I removed all the ambitious and extra to-be functionality, such as the auth for farmers :-)
Currently, I think it would be enough if FarMarkt worked independently of all the markets' organisers to serve its sole purpose of guiding the locals and tourists. However, I will add a "Contact" section with a form to provide a space for feedback.
To deal with the dates and calendars, I will use Luxon -- a very useful and easy-to-use library.



FarMarkt is (being) built using vanilla JS, MongoDB, HTML and SCSS and MapBox.
