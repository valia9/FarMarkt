# FarMarkt

Hello! This was my first major project, perhaps this is why it is still in progress.

FarMarkt is heavily based on Colt Steeles' project from his Udemy course, although
at some point I have given up the structure offered there and customised it:
now, it uses SCSS and in future will use more modern look of the tabs, where
each tab is devoted to a few sections versus each tab devoted to only one
section.

FarMarkt is meant to navigate Prague locals and tourists on the Farmers Markers (FM).
FM take place almost daily in here, depending on where you reside.
However, one big drawback is that there is no, essentially, a single page that would
be user-friendly enough to help everyone interested find the closest market -- 
geographically or time-wise. Thus, FarMarkt was born.
Initially, I would think of it as a too ambitios project. Currently, I think it must
be rather realistic to finish it, provided that there is ever enough time :-)

FarMarkt is (being) built using vanilla JS, MongoDB, HTML and SCSS and MapBox.
