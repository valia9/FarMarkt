# FarMarkt

Initially, FarMarkt was heavily based on Colt Steele's project from his [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). I finished this course in October 2021 and reimplemented what was taught there right away ⁠― and left it aside. Now, a year later, with more experience and a clearer vision, I decided to simplify the project drastically so it becomes usable ASAP. Naturally, it can barely be traced back to the course project and now can be rightfully considered an autonomous webpage.


FarMarkt is meant to navigate Prague locals and tourists on Prague Farmers Markers (FM). FM take place almost daily in the city, depending on where you reside. However, one big drawback of this experience is the absence of a webpage that would be user-friendly enough to help everyone interested find the closest market -- geographically or time/date-wise. Like many beautiful projects, FarMarkt was born out of frustration from not having a properly working system for something that deserves one.


FarMarkt is (being) built using vanillaJS, MongoDB, HTML and Sass; Luxon and MapBox among the packages.
